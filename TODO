# TODO

- Implement fitter
- Discuss FrequencyConfig with client
- Fix little TODOs in code
- Write unit tests
- Use a proper command line parsing library
- The former probably requires some sort of package mangement like maven
- Add build system (Make / Ant) to compile, package, generate docs
- Consider if some members and methods should be protected/private
- Improve documentation
